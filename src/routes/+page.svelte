		<h2>About Fidough</h2>
		<p>According to Bulbapedia:</p>

		<blockquote>
			"Fidough is a small canine Pokémon with a large head and stubby legs. The head contains small,
			black beady eyes with rounded eyebrow-like growths on top; a snout with a rounded triangular
			nose and a tiny mouth; and rounded ears that resemble pastries or bread buns. Fidough has a
			large dewlap on its neck, on which it is able to rest its head while sleeping. Its back has
			multiple protrusions that resemble a braid, and its tail is composed of two bulbous segments.
			Its fur is off-white in coloration, with yellow accents on the top of its head, its eyebrows,
			the insides of its ears, around its neck, and on its tail. Fidough's smooth, moist skin is
			firm yet soft to the touch, and has elastic qualities; when agitated, Fidough will puff itself
			up to appear larger, in an attempt to intimidate its opponents. Fidough's breath contains
			yeast and is used to ferment things. Fidough has long been considered a companion for
			humanity, because its yeast is useful for cooking."
